# Ads Click Prediction by Classification Machine Learning

Background: Online advertising has become a crucial part of digital marketing strategies. Advertisers pay for their ads to be shown to potential customers, but the success of an ad campaign depends on the users clicking on the ads. Therefore, predicting which ads are more likely to be clicked can help advertisers optimize their ad campaigns and save money.

Problem: The problem is to predict whether a user will click on an ad or not, given certain features such as user demographics, search history, and ad characteristics. This is a classification problem, where the goal is to classify ads as either clicked or not clicked.

Goal: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a user will click on an ad or not. The model should be trained on historical ad impression and click data and be able to generalize to new ads and users. The ultimate objective is to help advertisers increase the click-through rate of their ads and improve the return on investment of their ad campaigns.
